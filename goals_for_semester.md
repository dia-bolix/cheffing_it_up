# Cheffing It Up

2. Set out goals for this semester. Please detail what the requiement is that each goals will meet, and how you expect to meet it.

# Goals

1. Implementing authentication and authorization:
- Use a library such as Flask-Login to handle authentication and authorization.
- Store user credentials securely in the database, such as hashing the passwords.
- Assign roles to users such as administrator, user, etc. to control access to certain endpoints.
- Add security features such as rate-limiting and password strength validation (Might not need for this app).

2. Adding pagination:
- Break up the result set from database queries into smaller chunks or pages.
- Provide navigation links to view the next or previous pages.
- Use the limit and skip parameters in MongoDB to implement pagination.

3. Deploying the application:
- Choose a hosting platform such as pythonanywhere or Heroku
- Configure the hosting platform to run your application.
- Set up the database on the hosting platform.
- Deploy your application to the hosting platform.
- Test the deployed application to ensure that it is working correctly.

# Further goals 

1. Implementing logging:
- Use a logging library such as the built-in Python logging module
- Log important events such as user sign-ups, recipe additions, and database queries.
- Set different logging levels (e.g. error, warning, info) to control the amount of information that is logged.

2. Optimizing database queries:
- Use indexes to speed up queries.
